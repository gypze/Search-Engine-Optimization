## Optimizations

I first added a header element

I reorganized the HTML headings

I changed the div element to the nav element as it specifies that the content is navigation related so that users with disabilites can understand the information.

I added alt text next to the all of the image links so that the technology that exists for users with disabilites could be used.

I organized the ul, li, and a href code removing whitespace so that the code is more organized

## Lessons Learned/Challenges


Considering the fact that I started with almost no knowlege of what coding was, or how to build a website I think I did pretty well.
I learned how to utilize the world wide web for help. There really are so many resources out there.
When I was trying to fix issue with Search Engine Optimization text I couldn't get the css to adapt to the change that I made with the HTML.
I learned how to commit, but I could't figure out why my messages didn't show up where I expected them too.
Most Impotantly I learned how essential working with a team can be. If it wasn't for the help I received from those in my group, I would not have gotten as far as I did on this project.
